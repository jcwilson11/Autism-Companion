To do this, I designed and 3D-printed an enclosed sensor network that would measure temperature, relative humidity, and light and placed it outdoors on campus. Each day, the sensor network collected data every thirty minutes and wirelessly published it to the Stevens MQTT server, allowing us to analyze how conditions were changing throughout the day.</td>
